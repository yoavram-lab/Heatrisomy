% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
Aneuploidy is common in eukaryotes, often leading to decreased cell growth and fitness. However, evidence from yeast and fungi, as well as human tumour cells, suggests that aneuploidy can be beneficial under stressful conditions and lead to elevated growth rates and adaptation.
Importantly, aneuploidy differs from point mutations in rate, fitness effect, and reversibility.
Here, we develop evolutionary models for adaptive evolution with both mutation and aneuploidy. 
These models are used within an approximate Bayesian computation framework to estimate the formation rate and fitness effect of aneuploidy and mutation from  results of evolutionary experiments in which \yeast adapted to heat stress: the experimental populations first acquired chromosome duplications, only to later revert back to a euploid state.
We also analyze our models to estimate the effect of the aneuploidy and mutation rates on the expected adaptation time and the probability for adaptation via aneuploidy.
Our results suggest that aneuploidy can be a transient adaptive solution, which can decelerate adaptation in a non-intuitive manner. By creating an evolutionary conflict between the individual and the population, aneuploidy further complicates the process of adaptation in cell populations.

% Introduction
\section*{Introduction}

\paragraph*{Aneuploidy is common in eukaryotes.}
Aneuploidy is an imbalance in the number of chromosomes in the cell: an incorrect karyotype.
Evidence suggests aneuploidy is very common in eukaryotes, e.g. animals~\citep{Santaguida2015review, Naylor2016, Bakhoum2017}, and fungi~\citep{Pavelka2010, Zhu2016, Robbins2017, Todd2017}.
Aneuploidy has been implicated in cancer formation and progression~\citep{Boveri2008, Schvartzman2010}: 
90\% of solid tumours and 50\% of blood cancers are aneuploid~\citep{Santaguida2015review}.
Aneuploidy is also linked to the emergence of drug resistance~\citep{Selmecki2009} and virulence~\citep{Moller2018} in fungal pathogens, which are under-studied~\citep{Rodrigues2018} despite infecting close to a billion people per year, causing serious infections and significant morbidity in >150 million people per year and killing >1.5 million people per year~\citep{Selmecki2009, Rodrigues2018}.
In addition, aneuploidy is common in protozoan pathogens of the Leishmania genus, a major global health concern~\citep{Mannaert2012}.

\paragraph*{Aneuploidy is generally deleterious.}
The molecular and genetic mechanisms involved in aneuploidy have been explored~\citep{Musacchio2007, Sheltzer2011, Chen2012b, Rancati2013, Gerstein2015, Shor2015}.
Experiments with human and mouse embryos found that aneuploidy is usually lethal.
It is also associated with developmental defects and lethality in other multicellular organisms~\citep{Sheltzer2011}. For example, aneuploid mouse embryonic cells grow slower than euploid cells~\citep{Williams2008}.
Similarly, in unicellular eukaryotes growing in benign conditions, aneuploidy usually leads to slower growth and decreased overall fitness~\citep{Niwa2006, Torres2007, Pavelka2010, Sheltzer2011, Kasuga2016}, in part due to proteotoxic stress caused by increased expression in aneuploid cells~\citep{Pavelka2010, Santaguida2015, Zhu2018} and hypo-osmotic-like stress~\citep{Tsai2019}.

\paragraph*{Aneuploidy can lead to adaptation.}
However, aneuploidy can be beneficial under stressful conditions due to the wide range of phenotypes it can produce, some of which are advantageous~\citep{Pavelka2010}.
Thus, aneuploidy can lead to rapid adaptation in unicellular eukaryotes~\citep{Gerstein2015,Torres2010, Hong2014, Rancati2008}, as well as to rapid growth of somatic tumour cells~\citep{Schvartzman2010, Sheltzer2017}.
For example, aneuploidy in \yeast facilitates adaptation to a variety of stressful conditions like heat and pH~\citep{Yona2012}, copper~\citep{Covo2014, Gerstein2015}, salt~\citep{Dhar2011}, and nutrient limitation~\citep{Dunham2002, Gresham2008}.
Importantly, aneuploidy can also lead to drug resistance in pathogenic fungi such as \calbicans~\citep{Selmecki2008, Selmecki2010, Gerstein2018} and \cneoformans~\citep{Sionov2010}, which cause candidiasis and meningoencephalitis, respectively.

\paragraph*{Transient adaptive solution.} 
Aneuploidy differs from mutation due to its distinct properties. 
Chromosome duplication usually occurs more often than mutation and on average produces larger fitness effects.
Yet, because it affects many genes on a whole chromosome or a chromosome fragment, aneuploidy also carries fitness costs.
Thus, aneuploidy can be a \emph{transient adaptive solution}: it can rapidly occur and fix in the population under stressful conditions, and can be rapidly lost when the cost outweighs the benefit---when stress is removed or after beneficial mutations occur.
Experimental evidence of such a transient role of aneuploidy was demonstrated by \citet{Yona2012}. They evolved populations of \yeast under strong heat or pH stress.
The populations adapted to the heat and pH stress within 450 and 150 generations, and this adaptation was determined to be due to chromosome duplications.
Much later, after more than 1500 and 750 generations, for the heat and pH stress, respectively, the populations reverted back to an euploid state, while remaining adapted to the stress and accumulating multiple mutations.
However, under gradual heat stress, aneuploidy was not observed.
\citet{Yona2012} concluded that aneuploidy serves as a transient adaptive solution, or a ``quick fix'', which is expected to facilitate adaptation. 

\paragraph*{The present study.}
Here, we develop evolutionary-genetic models that include the effects of natural selection, genetic drift, aneuploidy, and mutation to examine the role of aneuploidy in adaptive evolution.
These models follow a population of cells characterised by both their ploidy and their genotype.
We fit these models to the experimental results of \citet{Yona2012} using an \emph{approximate Bayesian computation} framework~\citep{Sisson2009} to infer model parameters, including selection coefficients and rates of aneuploidy and mutation, and to perform model selection between different models, thereby testing hypotheses about the evolutionary process. 
We analyze these evolutionary-genetic models to estimate the effects of parameters on the adaptation time and the probability for adaptation via aneuploidy.
We find that \textbf{TODO} % TODO

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph*{Evolutionary Models.}
We model the evolution of a population of cells using two models: a single-locus model and a multi-locus model.
Both models are based on the Wright-Fisher model~\citep{Otto2007}, assuming non-overlapping generations and including the effects of natural selection, genetic drift, aneuploidy, and mutation. 
We focus on beneficial mutations, neglecting the effects of deleterious and neutral mutations. Both models allow for a single aneuploid karyotype (e.g., chromosome III duplication).
While the single-locus model allows for only a single mutation to accumulate in the genotype, the multi-locus model allows for multiple mutations to accumulate~(\autoref{fig:models}), as well as for a fluctuating population size.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph*{Single-locus model.}
This model assumes a constant effective population size $N$ and follows four genotypes~(\autoref{fig:models}A): euploid wild-type, \euwt, the initial genotype; 
euploid mutant, \eumt, with the standard karyotype and a single beneficial mutation; 
aneuploid wild-type, \anwt, with an extra chromosome, i.e., following chromosome duplication; and
aneuploid mutant, \anmt, with and extra chromosome and a beneficial mutation. 

Transitions between the genotypes occur as follows~(\autoref{fig:models}A): Beneficial mutations from \euwt\; to \eumt\; occur with probability $\mu$, the mutation rate, and from \anwt\; to \anmt\; with probability $\tau \mu$, where $\tau$ is the fold-change in the rate of beneficial mutations in aneuploid cells. By default, we assume $\tau=33/32$, as the wild-type \yeast strains in the experiments by \citep{Yona2012} are diploid with 32 chromosomes, and the aneuploid strains are trisomic, with 33 chromosomes. We neglect back-mutations (i.e., from \eumt\; to \euwt\; and from \anmt\; to \anwt).
Aneuploidy is formed by chromosome mis-segregation, so that cells transition from \euwt\; to \anwt\; and from \anmt\ to \eumt\ with probability $\delta$, the aneuploidy rate. That is, we assume chromosomes are gained and lost at the same rate, and we neglect events that form a less-fit genotype (i.e., \anwt\; to \euwt\; and \eumt\; to \anmt).
The fitness values of the four genotypes are given by \autoref{table:single-locus}.

\end{table}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The initial population has $N$ cells with genotype \euwt.
The effect of natural selection on the frequency $f_i$ of genotype $i = 2n, 2n+1, 2n+1^*, \text{or } 2n^*$ is given by
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:selection-single} 
      f^s_i = \frac{f_i w_i}{\bar{w}} \;,
    \end{equation}
where the fitness values $w_i$ are given in \autoref{table:single-locus} and $\bar{w} = \sum_{j}{f_j w_j}$ is the population mean fitness.
The effect of mutation and aneuploidy on genotype frequencies is given by
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:mutation-aneuploidy-single}
    \begin{aligned}
      &f^m_{2n} &=&\; (1 - \delta - \mu) f^s_{2n}  \;,\\
      &f^m_{2n+1} &=&\; \delta f^s_{2n} + (1 - \tau \mu) f^s_{2n+1}  \;,\\
      &f^m_{2n+1^*} &=&\; \tau \mu f^s_{2n+1} + (1-\delta) f^s_{2n+1^*}  \;,\\
      &f^m_{2n^*} &=&\; \mu f^s_{2n} + \delta f^s_{2n+1} + f^s_{2n^*}  \;.
    \end{aligned}
    \end{equation}
Finally, random genetic drift is modeled using a multinomial distribution~\citep{Otto2007},
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:drift-single}
      \vec{f'} \sim \frac{1}{N} \cdot \mathit{Mult}(N,\ \vec{f^m}) \;,
    \end{equation}
where $\vec{f^m}=(f^m_{2n}\ ,\ f^m_{2n+1}\ ,\ f^m_{2n+1^*}\ ,\ f^m_{2n^*})$ are the frequencies of the genotypes after mutation and aneuploidy, $\vec{f'}$ are the genotype frequencies in the next generation, and $Mult(N,\ \vec{f})$ is a multinomial distribution parameterized by the population size $N$ and the genotype frequencies $\vec{f}$.
Overall, the change in genotype frequencies from one generation to the next is given by the transformation $f_i \to f'_i$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph*{Multi-locus model.}
This model expands the single-locus model by allowing for (i) the accumulation of beneficial mutations, and (ii) a fluctuating population size. 

A genotype is characterized by its karyotype, \euwt\; or \anwt, and the number of accumulated beneficial mutations, which can be zero or more.
The selection coefficient of the $i$-th accumulated mutation in each individual, $s_i$, is drawn from an exponential distribution with expected value $s$: $s_i \sim \mathit{Exp{(s)}}$.
The rest of the parameters ($N$, $\mu$, $\tau$, $\delta$, $b$, $c$) are the same as in the single-locus model. However, since the multi-locus model allows several mutations with smaller fitness effects to accumulate, we expect the mutation rate to be higher compared to the single-locus model, which focuses on a single, large-effect mutation.
% TODO : add tau to model fixed at 33/32.

The fitness of the different genotypes is the same as in the single-locus model (\autoref{table:single-locus}), except that the fitness contribution of $k$ beneficial mutations is the product of their independent effects, $\prod_{i=1}^k(1+s_i)$, instead of the contribution of the single mutation allowed in the single-locus model, $(1+s)$, see \autoref{table:multi-locus}.
Therefore, aneuploidy loss would be favored by selection only if there are enough beneficial mutations and/or the selection coefficients $s_i$ are large enough. The intuition is that when the benefit of the accumulated beneficial mutations is small, ten the benefit of aneuploidy has a large effect; when the benefit of the accumulated beneficial mutations is large, then aneuploidy is no longer beneficial due of its fitness cost.

In contrast to the single-locus model, in the multi-locus model the population size fluctuates to model serial-transfer experimental protocol~\citep{Yona2012}: the population is serially diluted by transferring a fraction of the population (1/120) to a fresh medium approximately every seven generations. 
Thus, the population initial size is $N_0 = N$, and the population size is doubled every generation, $N_1=2N, N_2=4N, \ldots$, and diluted back to $N$ after seven generations such that $N_8=N$.

The change in frequencies due to selection is exactly the same as in the single-locus model (\autoref{eq:selection-single}), only applied using the fitness values in \autoref{table:multi-locus}. The change due to random genetic drift is also the same as in \autoref{eq:drift-single}, except that the frequencies vector is $\vec{f}=(f_{2n}\ ,\ f_{2n+1}\ ,\ f_{2n^*}\ ,\ f_{2n+1^*}\ ,\ f_{2n^{**}}\ ,\ f_{2n+1^{**}}\ ,\ \ldots)$ and that the population size changes between generations, as described above.

The effects of mutation and aneuploidy on genotype frequencies is more elaborate than in the single-locus model.
Genotype $i$ is classified according to its karyotype (\euwt\ or \anwt), the number of accumulated beneficial mutations ($k \ge 0$), and their fitness ($w_i$).
Each offspring cell inherits these properties from its mother cell.
Then, with probability $\mu$ or $\tau \mu$ for euploid and aneuploid cells,
respectively, a new beneficial mutation is accumulated, such that the number of mutations is $k+1$, and its effect $s_{k+1}$ is drawn from an exponential distribution with expected value $s$, such that the contribution of the mutations to the fitness is $\prod_{j=0}^{k+1}{(1+s_j)}$.
Next, euploid offspring become aneuploid with probability $\delta$, and aneuploid offspring become euploid with probability $\delta_L$.

\paragraph{Empirical evidence.}

We use the results of evolutionary experiments reported by \citet{Yona2012}.
In their heat-stress experiment, four populations of \yeast evolved under \SI{39}{\celsius}. Aneuploidy fixed in all four population in the first 450 generations (hereafter, fixation or elimination of a genotype \emph{by generation $t$} means that more than 95\% or less than 5\% of the population carry the genotype at generation $t$, and possibly earlier). From unpublished results, aneuploidy did not fix before at least 200 generations elapsed.
The experiment continued with two populations, in which aneuploidy was eliminated by generation 1,700 and 2,350.
%Thus, the empirical evidence can be summarized by $\vec{X}=\Big(200 \le T_i(2n+1) \le 450,\, i=1,2,3,4;\ T_1(2n^*)=1700;\ T_2(2n^*)=2350\Big)$ where $T_i(g)$ is the fixation time of genotype $g$ in population $i$.

\paragraph{Likelihood function.} 

Because our model, just like the Wright-Fisher model, is non-linear and stochastic, computing the distribution of fixation time $T(g)$ of genotype $g$ for use in the likelihood function is intractable (it is even hard to use a diffusion-equation approximation due to the model having multiple genotypes, rather than just two).
We overcome this problem by approximating the likelihood using simulations. We simulate 1,000 experiments per parameter vector $\theta = (\mu, \tau, \delta, s, b, c)$, resulting in a set of simulated observations $\tilde{\vec X} = \{\tilde{X}_i\}_{i=1}^{1000}$. We then compute the approximate likelihood,
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:heatstress-likelihood}
\likelihood(\theta) = &\ P^4(200 \le T(2n+1) \le 450) \cdot 
	\Big[1 - \\
	&	P_{\tilde{\vec X}}^4\big(!\{T(2n^*)<1700\} \mid 200 \le T(2n+1) \le 450\big)- \\
	&	P_{\tilde{\vec X}}^4\big(!\{1700 < T(2n^*) < 2350\} \mid 200 \le T(2n+1) \le 450\big)+ \\
	&	P_{\tilde{\vec X}}^4\big(!\{T(2n^*)<1700\} \land !\{1700 < T(2n^*) < 2350\} \mid 200 \le T(2n+1) \le 450\big) 
	\Big]\;,
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
where $!\{\ldots\}$ is the "logical not" operator, $P^4(\ldots)$ is the 4th power of $P(\ldots)$, and all probabilities $P_{\tilde{\vec X}}(\ldots)$ are approximated from the results of the simulations $\tilde{\vec X}$. For example, $P_{\tilde{\vec X}}\big(!\{T(2n^*)<1700\} \mid 200 \le T(2n+1) \le 450\big)$ is approximated by taking simulations in which \anwt\; fixed before generation 450 but not before generation 200, and computing the fraction of such simulations in which \eumt\; did not fix by generation 1,700, and hence aneuploidy did not extinct before generation 1,700.


%Denote by $A_{t,T}$ the fixation of aneuploidy by generation $t$ conditioned on no fixation up to generation $T$; by $B_{t}$ the extinction of aneuploidy by generation $t$; and by $C_{t,T}$ the extinction of aneuploidy by generation $t$ conditioned on no extinction by generation $T$.
%The likelihood function for parameter vector $\theta$ conditioned on the observed data $\vec{X}$ from the heat-stress experiment is
%\begin{multline} \label{eq:heatstress-likelihood}
%P^4(A_{450,200}) \cdot \Big(1 - P^4(\lnot{B_{1700}} | A_{450,200} ) - P^4(\lnot{C_{2350, 1700}}| A_{450,200}) + P^4(\lnot{B_{1700}} \land \lnot{C_{2350, 1700}}| A_{450,200})\Big)	\;,	 % TODO fix L* (YR)
%\end{multline}
%where $P(X)$ is the probability of event $X$ and $\lnot$ means \emph{not}. 
 
For a model without aneuploidy (that is, when the aneuploidy rate is fixed at zero, $\delta=0$), 
%denote by $M_{t}$ the fixation of \eumt\ by generation $t$, and by $Q_{t,T}$ the fixation of \eumt\ by generation $t$ conditioned on no fixation at generation $T$.
the likelihood is similarly approximated by
% of a model without aneuploidy with parameter vector $\theta$ for the heat-stress experiment is
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:heatstress-noaneuploidy-likelihood}
\likelihood_{!}(\theta) = &\

	P_{\tilde{\vec X}}^4\big(!\{T(2n^*)<1700\}\big) - \\
&	P_{\tilde{\vec X}}^4\big(!\{1700 < T(2n^*) < 2350\}\big) + \\
&	P_{\tilde{\vec X}}^4\big(!\{T(2n^*)<1700\} \land !\{1700 < T(2n^*) < 2350\}\big)
\;.
\end{aligned}\end{equation}

%\begin{multline} \label{eq:heatstress-noaneuploidy-likelihood}
%\likelihood_{!}(\theta) = 
%\Big(1 - P^4(\lnot{M_{1700}}) - P^4(\lnot{Q_{2350, 1700}}) + P^4(\lnot{M_{1700}} \land \lnot{Q_{2350, 1700}})\Big)	\;,	
%\end{multline}

\paragraph{Parameter inference.} To infer model parameters, we use approximate Bayesian computation with a sequential Monte-Carlo scheme, or ABC-SMC~\citep{Sisson2009}, implemented in the \texttt{pyABC} Python package~\citep[\href{https://pyabc.readthedocs.io}{pyabc.readthedocs.io}]{Klinger2018}.
This approach uses numerical stochastic simulations of the model to infer a posterior distribution over the model parameters. It is a method of likelihood-free, simulation-based inference~\citep{Cranmer2020}, that is, for estimating a posterior distribution when a likelihood function cannot be directly computed. It is therefore suitable to our case, in which the likelihood function can only be approximated from simulations, and cannot be directly computed. 

Briefly, the ABS-SMC algorithm employs sequential importance sampling over multiple iterations~\citep{Syga2021}. 
In iteration $t$ of the algorithm, we continue to sample a parameter vector $\theta$, also called \emph{particle}, and simulate observations $\tilde{\vec X}$, until $n_t$ particles are accepted. 
A particle $\theta$ is accepted if its approximate likelihood is high enough, $\likelihood(\theta)>1-\epsilon_t$ (or more commonly, if $1-\likelihood(\theta) < \epsilon_t$), where $\epsilon_t>0$ is the \emph{acceptance threshold}, as higher values of $\epsilon_t$ allow more particles to be accepted. 
The acceptance threshold $\epsilon_t$ is chosen as the median of the $1-\likelihood(\theta)$ of the particles accepted in the previous iteration, $t-1$, and $\epsilon_0=0.01$. 
The proposed particles are sampled from a proposal distribution: for $t=0$, this is the prior distribution, and for $t>0$ the proposal distribution is constructed using the pertrubation kernel $K$, that is a multivariate normal kernel with adaptive covariance matrix from the particles accepted in the previous iteration ~\citep{Klinger2017}.
The number of particles, $n_t$, is adapted at every iteration $t$ using the \emph{adaptive population strategy}~\citep{Klinger2017}.
For each accepted particle $\theta$ the weight $w_t(\theta)$ is assigned: for $t=0$ it is 1, and for $t>0$ it is equal to the prior of $\theta$ divided by $\sum_{\theta^*}{w_{t-1}(\theta^*) K(\theta,\theta^*)}$, when $\theta^*$ is a particle accepted in the previous iteration.   ~\citep{Toni2009}.

Acceptance is determined according to the approximate likelihood, which has a maximum value of 0.875. Thus, we terminated the inference when $\epsilon \le 0.13$ after four iterations, with $n_4=1,074$ accepted parameter vectors and effective sample size (ESS) 700 (\autoref{fig:ess-single}). % TODO for multi-locus model we need to say something else
Running the inference algorithm with different initialization seeds and different number of simulations with produced similar outcomes (\autoref{fig:seeds}). %TODO for multi-locus model, write about them here also.

After producing a set of weighted particles from the the posterior distribution using the above ABC-SMC algorithm, we approximate the posterior using kernel density estimation (KDE) with Gaussian kernels, from which we find the MAP (maximum a posteriori) estimate as the maximum of the KDE function. We then draw $50,000$ samples from the posterior KDE to compute the HDI (highest density interval) and visualize the posterior distribution with histograms.

\paragraph{Model comparison.} We perform model selection using WAIC, the widely applicable information criterion ~\citep{gelman2013bayesian},
\begin{equation} \label{eq:WAIC}
\begin{aligned}
\mathit{WAIC}(\theta) &\ =\ 
-2\log\mathbb{E}[\likelihood(\theta)]\ +\ 2\mathbb{V}[\log\likelihood(\theta)]
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is a parameter vector, and $\mathbb{E}[\cdot]$ and $\mathbb{V}[\cdot]$ are the expectation and variance taken over the posterior distribution.
WAIC values are scaled as a deviance measure: lower values imply higher predictive accuracy~\citep{Kass1995}.
% TODO Describe posterior plots comparison method - Fig 4 & S3
 
\paragraph{Prior distributions.} We used informative prior distributions for $w_{2n+1}=1-c+b$, $w_{2n+1^*}=(1+s)(1-c)+b$ and $w_{2n^*}=1+s$, which we estimated from growth curves data from mono-culture growth experiments previously reported by \citet[Figs. 3C, 4A, and S2]{Yona2012}.
We used \texttt{Curveball}, a method for predicting results of competition experiments from growth curve data~\citep[\href{https://curveball.yoavram.com}{curveball.yoavram.com}]{Ram2019}. Briefly, \texttt{Curveball} takes growth curves of two strains growing separately in mono-culture and predicts how they would grow in a mixed culture, that is, it predicts the results of a competition assay.
From these predictions, relative fitness values can be computed. Because \texttt{Curveball} uses a maximum-likelihood approach to estimate model parameters, we were able to estimate a distribution of relative fitness values by sampling from a truncated multivariate normal distribution defined by the maximum-likelihood covariance matrix. We sampled 10,000 samples to use as a prior distribution~(Figures~\ref{fig:growth-curves-30deg} and~\ref{fig:growth-curves-39deg}).

We used growth curves of \euwt\ and \anwt\ in \SI{39}{\celsius} to estimate a prior distribution for $w_{2n+1}$. In lieu of a better prior, we used the same prior for $w_{2n+1^*}$ and $w_{2n^*}$. 
%TODO please report here the point estimate and 95% CI for the three distributions, I only have for 1-c+b: 0.9863 (95% CI 0.9790 - 0.9939).
Compared to other priors we tested, this prior produced lower WAIC, better posterior prediction plots, and more stable parameter estimates, as follows.
We tested a uninformative uniform prior with $\mathit{U}(1,6)$, for (i) all $w_{2n+1}$, $w_{2n+1^*}$, $w_{2n^*}$ and (ii) only for $w_{2n+1^*}$, $w_{2n^*}$, using the above informative prior for $w_{2n+1}$.
In both of these uninformative priors, the fitness estimates were much too high: for the first prior the median estimates were  $w_{2n+1}=2.767$, $w_{2n+1^*}=5.79$, $w_{2n^*}=5.827$ and for the second prior the estimates were $w_{2n+1}=1.046$, $w_{2n+1^*}=4.642$, $w_{2n^*}=4.684$. Such high fitness values are unreasonable. Moreover the WAIC for the models with these priors were 0.57 and 1.9, respectively, whereas the WAIC with the informative prior was 0.27. 
% TODO if you need to remove this sentence: Also, with the uninformative prior for all fitness values, the fixation time of \anwt is about 16 on average, much lower than the (unpublished) experimental result, which is 200-300 generations.

We tried to use additional growth curves. We used growth curves of \eumt\; (\emph{refined} strain from \citet{Yona2012}) and \anwt\; in \SI{39}{\celsius} to estimate $w_{2n*}/w_{2n+1}$. The same prior was used for $w_{2n*}/w_{2n+1*}$. This prior resulted in WAIC 2.8, compared to 0.27 with the above informative prior.
We also tried to use growth curves of \anwt\; and \euwt\; in \SI{30}{\celsius} to estimate $1-c$. This estimation assumes that the cost of aneuploidy is the same in \SI{39}{\celsius} and \SI{30}{\celsius}; this might be incorrect, but we only assumed this to generate a prior distribution for the fitness values. The prior for $b$ was taken the same as for $c$. This prior did not work at all, as no parameter sets were found with an approximate likelihood greater than zero.
% TODO it make sense because bla bla (to explain)

% TODO : Actually I assume in code that  w(2n*)>w(2n+1*)>w(2n+1)>w(2n) just for speeding up the simulations (I don't check some parameters combinations in this way). But I checked also that when I don't adding this constrain the result was the same. However I dind't add reverse direction in this case.
 
For the mutation rate, $\mu$, and aneuploidy rate, $\delta$, we used uninformative uniform priors, $\mu \sim \mathit{U}(10^{-9}\ ,\ 10^{-5})$ and $\delta \sim \mathit{U}(10^{-6} , 10^{-2})$.
For a model without aneuploidy ($\delta=0$), we used a wider uniform prior for the mutation rate, $\mu \sim \mathit{U}(10^{-10},10^{-5})$.

\paragraph{Parameter estimation.} 
We used ABC-SMC to infer the posterior distribution of the parameters of the single-locus model.
The MAP (maximum a posteriori) and 50\% HDI (highest density interval) of the parameters posterior are~(\autoref{fig:posterior}):
mutation rate, $\mu=3.06\substack{+1.229 \\ -2.84}\times10^{-6}$,
aneuploidy rate, $\delta=1.61\substack{+1.122 \\ -0.197}\times10^{-3}$,
and fitness values, $w_{2n+1}=1.022\substack{+0.001 \\ -0.002}$,
$w_{2n+1*}=1.025\substack{+0.001 \\ -0.001}$,
$w_{2n*}=1.028\substack{+0.001 \\ -0.002}$, all relative to the fitness of \euwt, which is set to $w_{2n}=1$.
% describe b and c
This estimated aneuploidy rate agrees with previous estimates. % TODO refs
The mutation rate corresponds to a mutation target size of $10^{4}$, assuming the mutation rate per base pair is roughly $2\cdot10^{-10}$~\citep{Zhu2014}. 
%We can see from the posterior distribution~(\autoref{fig:posterior}) the correlation between fitness of different genotypes. 
% TODO say/plot something about the correlation: which fitness values are correlated? how strong is it? why does it occur?

We also tried to inference parameters of the single-locus model with different $\tau$: 1, 2, 5, 10 and 100. It was seen that for 1, 2, 5 the posterior was not significantly different from the model with $\tau=33/32$, while for $\tau=10$ the estimated $\mu\ $ was a little lower, $1.654\substack{+0.879 \\ -1.775}\times10^{-6}$, and for $\tau=100$ the estimated $\mu\ $ was already significantly lower and $\delta\ $ had higher variability. The MAP and 50\% HDI for $\tau=100$:
$\mu=5.538\substack{+1.611 \\ -5.311}\times10^{-7}$,
$\delta=8.292\substack{+8.988 \\ -4.96}\times10^{-4}$,
$w_{2n+1}=1.023\substack{+0.001 \\ -0.002}$,
$w_{2n+1*}=1.024\substack{+0.001 \\ -0.001}$,
$w_{2n*}=1.028\substack{+0.001 \\ -0.002}$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\paragraph{Model checking and comparison.}
The single-locus model fits the data well: in simulations using the best-fit parameters (MAP estimate) \eumt\ fixed in 59\% of simulations by generation 1,700 and in 100\% of simulations by generation 2,350~(\autoref{fig:2n*-fixation}) and \anwt\ fixed in roughly 300 generations on average (green lines in \autoref{fig:ppc-plot}), which agrees with experimental results.
% TODO replace "roughly 300" with the exact number.
% TODO this fig shows fixation of 2n*, what about fixation of 2n+1?
% TODO merge fig 3 and fig:likelihood (both panels of fig:likelihood) 
Interestingly, the genotype frequency dynamics in these simulations demonstrate that \anmt\ never reaches substantial frequency (\autoref{fig:ppc-plot}). % TODO move somewhere else?
Furthermore, sensitivity analysis shows that changing the parameter values from the MAP estimate reduces the model fit to the experimental results~(\autoref{fig:sensitivity}).

However, a model without aneuploidy where the aneuploidy rate is fixed at zero, $\delta=0$, cannot explain the experimental observations~(Figures~\ref{fig:2n*-fixation} and \ref{fig:likelihood}). The estimated parameter values without aneuploidy are:
mutation rate, $\mu=1.251\substack{+0.146 \\ -0.177}\times10^{-8}$,
%2n+1 fitness - $1.01\substack{+0.001 \\ -0.002}$,
%2n+1* fitness - $1.011\substack{+0.001 \\ -0.001}$,
%TODO why do you have fitness of aneuploidy when there is no aneuploidy?
fitness of mutant, $w_{2n^*}=1.011\substack{+0.001 \\ -0.001}$. 
We can see that the mutation rate estimate in this model is much lower than in the model with aneuploidy. Higher mutation rate would cause quicker fixation of \eumt\ than in the experimental obvservations (\autoref{fig:2n*-fixation}). Thus, even disregarding the appearance of trisomic cells in the experiment, the evidence supports the inclusion of aneuploidy in the model.

% Discussion
\section*{Discussion}

\paragraph*{Aneuploidy is not just another type of mutation.}
The published data indicate that, like mutation, aneuploidy can be both deleterious and beneficial~\citep{Pavelka2010, Sheltzer2011}.
Nevertheless, there are important and fundamental differences between adaptation by aneuploidy
and adaptation by beneficial mutations~\citep{Yona2015}, which make aneuploidy a unique mechanism for generating genetic
variation.
First, the aneuploidy rate (i.e. the frequency of mis-segregation events) is significantly higher than the
mutation rate~\citep{Santaguida2015review}.
Thus, everything else being equal, adaptation by aneuploidy will be faster and more frequent.
Second, fitness effects of aneuploidy are larger than those of the majority of mutations, on average, and are rarely
neutral~\citep{Pavelka2010, Yona2012, Sunshine2015}, allowing selection to quickly sort deleterious and beneficial genotypes.
Third, the number of different karyotypes is considerably smaller than the number of different genotypes, and different karyotypes are likely to have different phenotypes~\citep{Pavelka2010}.
Therefore, exploration of the phenotype space by aneuploidy requires smaller populations and a shorter time span.
Fourth, aneuploidy is a reversible state, as the rate of chromosome loss is high and the cost of aneuploidy is significant~\citep{Niwa2006}.
Indeed, aneuploidy often provides a transient solution: under short-term stress conditions, aneuploidy reverts (chromosome number returns to normal) when the stress subsides; under long-term stress conditions, aneuploidy reverts when refined solutions, generated by beneficial mutations, take over~\citep{Yona2012}.
Finally, aneuploidy results in increased genome instability, potentially increasing genetic variation by a positive feedback loop~\citep{Rancati2013, Bouchonville2009, Zhu2012}, while also increasing its own transience.

\paragraph*{Evolutionary theory of aneuploidy.}
The role of aneuploidy in adaptation has only recently been observed~\citep{Sionov2010, Yona2012, Gerstein2015}, and is largely missing from the literature on evolution and adaptation:
the introductory textbook \emph{Evolution} by~\citet{Bergstrom2012} does not mention the word aneuploidy, and the graduate-level book \emph{Mutation-Driven Evolution} by~\citet{Nei2013} only briefly mentions aneuploidy in the context of speciation, but not adaptation.
In recent reviews of the literature, aneuploidy is suggested to play an important role in fungal adaptation~\citep{Robbins2017, Todd2017} and cancer evolution~\citep{Santaguida2015review, Naylor2016, Sansregret2017}, yet these reviews cite no theoretical studies nor any quantitative models.
Indeed, evolutionary, ecological, and epidemiological studies mostly assume adaptation occurs via beneficial mutations, recombination, and sex.
Therefore, there is a critical need to develop an evolutionary theory of aneuploidy like the evolutionary theories of other mechanisms for generation of genetic variation, e.g. mutation~\citep{Lynch2010}, recombination~\citep{Hartfield2012}, and sex~\citep{Otto2009}.
An evolutionary theory of aneuploidy will be central to the interpretation of experimental and clinical observations and design of new hypotheses, experiments, and treatments~\citep{Carja2014}.
For example, despite the lack of theoretical models, aneuploidy has been invoked in a new strategy to combat pathogens and tumour cells by setting “evolutionary traps”~\citep{Gerstein2015,Chen2015}, in which a condition that predictably leads to emergence of aneuploidy is applied, followed by a condition that specifically selects against aneuploid cells.
