'"exposure to an antifungal drug led to positive selection of specific aneuploidies and gross chromosomal rearrangement"
"esults from this experimental evolution study mirror the analysis of clinical FluR strains: in both cases ,50{\%} of the cultures (3/6 in this study) exhibited aneuploidy associated with the acquisition of FluR and the presence of i(5L) correlated with the highest fluconazole MICs. Furthermore, loss of i(5L) correlated with a drop in fluconazole MIC levels [11,20]. The most surprising result is the early appearance of cells carrying multiple aneuploidies including, but not limited to i(5L)."


"The lack of detectable aneuploidy in untreated cells (Figures S4, S5) and detection of high rates of aneuploidy in drug treated cells ([11] and this study), as well as in strains isolated from patients [20] or from animals [43] suggests that C. albicans is exposed to constant selective pressure when it is propagated in mammalian hosts. We suggest that this selective pressure may be even stronger when C. albicans is exposed to antifungal drugs within the mammalian host."},
