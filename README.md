## Project structure

`ms` folder contains the manuscript `ms.pdf`, and latex and other files that are needed to build it.

`src/inference.py` - inference the parameters of the model using pyabc. Different priors are available. run `python inference.py` for the usage.

`src/inference-noaneuploidy.py` - inference the parameters of the model with no aneuploidy

`src/inference-neutralaneuploidy.py` - inference the parameters of the model with neutral aneuploidy

`src/models/singleLocus.model.py` -- the model that is used by the inference scripts


`data/` - contains growth curves data that is used in the inference scripts as a prior for fitness distributions

`results/` - inference execution results. Are used by the notebooks. Every folder of inference contains not only the inference `db` file, but also the source code (copy-paste of inference and model codes that were used) and the `params` file that contain all the parameters that the source code was executed with.


`src/notebooks/` - notebooks that are used to draw figures, calculate HDI, WAIC and so on. `ms.tex` contains reference for each notebook in comments for every figure and data that is generated by these notebooks.
